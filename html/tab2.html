<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

<h5>Observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  In my opinion, I think that the data from the plot is variable because in some
  months, such as November and January, they were months which KWH increased as
  159 and 163, but in December decrese a little bit as 152 KWH while in months
  like February and March that this numbers decrease a lot as 143 and 142 KWH
</p>
<h5>Relation among the dots regarding the colors</h5>
<p>
  I think that the relation among the dots regarding the colors is mostly is the ralation of the lineal regression and the dots because this line is used to predict the value of a variable as from others variables, also this line pass for the relation of the KWH data.

    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
</ul>
